Thank you Adam/Terry for taking the time to look at our ReadMe.

To start we would like to explain the trello board a little. 

We chose the character customization "app" as our project. We definetly had some big aspirations in our trello board that we knew we wouldn't be able to complete during this short 2 day time frame. However, we all agreed that the character customization was going to be part of a mobile game instead of a stand alone "app" (because why have just an app that can create characters if they aren't apart of something bigger). 

We decided to plan out the structure of the game the character customization would be integrated into. Code wise though we did soley focus on the character creation aspect of the trello board, and did not worry about scoring/points/leaderboards for the time being. Hopefully the idea we have translates and is orginized well in trello so that you can see and understand our plan of action. 


We struggled with GitHub duplicating packages and not using the gitignore file correctly.
